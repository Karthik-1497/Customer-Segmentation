# Customer Segmentation with RFM Analysis

## Introduction

Welcome to the Customer Segmentation with RFM Analysis project! This repository contains the code and resources for segmenting customers using RFM analysis.

## Project Overview

Customer segmentation is a critical task for businesses aiming to better understand their customer base. RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a powerful technique that categorizes customers based on their transaction behavior, helping businesses target marketing strategies more effectively.

This project focuses on implementing RFM analysis to segment customers based on their recent purchase history, purchase frequency, and monetary value. By grouping customers into meaningful segments, businesses can tailor their marketing efforts, improve customer retention, and increase revenue.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd your-project
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies (see [Requirements](#requirements)).

4. Follow the instructions in the [Usage](#usage) section to run the RFM analysis on your customer data.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn (for data visualization)

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```shell
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

Follow these steps to use the RFM analysis for customer segmentation:

1. Prepare your customer transaction data in a suitable format (see [Data](#data)).

2. Open the Jupyter notebook or Python script provided in the project directory.

3. Import the necessary libraries and load your data.

4. Run the RFM analysis code, which will generate customer segments based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value.

5. Explore and visualize the results to gain insights into your customer segments.

## Data

In the `data` directory, you can find sample customer transaction data in CSV format. You should replace this with your own dataset for analysis. Ensure your data includes the following columns:

- Customer ID
- Transaction Date
- Transaction Amount

## RFM Analysis

RFM Analysis stands for Recency, Frequency, Monetary Analysis:

- **Recency (R):** How recently a customer made a purchase. It is usually measured in days.

- **Frequency (F):** How often a customer makes a purchase within a specific time frame.

- **Monetary Value (M):** The total amount of money a customer has spent.

The analysis involves assigning each customer a score for each of these three factors and then segmenting them into groups based on these scores.

## Results

The project will provide you with segmented customer groups based on their RFM scores. These segments can be used for targeted marketing, product recommendations, and personalized communication strategies.
